# Adding a New Grammar

TSPM is not yet mature enough to accept new grammar contributions. Currently
the set of grammars is restricted to those that have unique properties like
precense or lack of certain tests/files/directories.

This documentation will be replaced with contribution instructions when TSPM
is ready to accept new packages.
